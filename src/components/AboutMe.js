          <p id= "abouttext">Asha Sanford is an Atlanta based Full Stack Web Developer and Animation major.I have a Bachelor's degree in Animation and a minor in Motion Graphics. I attended and graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design back in 2019. I have also worked as an Assistant Art teacher for approximately 3 years now. Web Design caught my attention once I realized how interexhancable technical skills can be across all different industries and jobs. I started the Georgia Tech Coding bootcamp in February 2021, and expect to complete by August 2021.
